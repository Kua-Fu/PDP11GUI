# PDP11GUI
PDP11GUI is an integrated development environment (IDE) for PDP-11â€™s, running under MS Windows.

It is intended as a tool to explore and repair PDP-11's.

Communicates with a physical PDP-11 or SimH over console interface. With this basic interface, lots of functions are realized:

-You can inspect memory and CPU and device registers

-Registers are fully documented, even bitwise.

-You can write programms in assembler and load them onto the PDP-11, run programs or single step them

-A disassembler is included

-Basic memory test and read/dump memory in various formats.

-Files in "Absolute Papertape format" can be written to memory, allowing most XXDP diagnostics to be deposited and run.

-Special drivers can read and write data from disks.
