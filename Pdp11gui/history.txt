PDP11GUI Revision history:
--------------------------

22.10.2016: V 1.48.5
                - Disk Image Read/Write: after driver start, wait until
                  any serial output is discarded.

24.9.2016:  V 1.48.4
                - Disk Image Read/Write: Current BlockNr saved with Bad Block list
                  and restored on Load, if "Track" checkbox checked.
                - Robotron_K5502 reduced from 34 to 32 sectors

                - Disk Image Read/Write: RLE compression recognizes
                  now 2-word patterns. Some disks format sectors with a
                  alternating word pattern, these can now be compressed.
                  (Robotron K5501). Compresses also automatically 1 word patterns.
17.8.2016:  V.1.48.1

                - bugfix:  block count in "TFormDiscImage.ReadMultiBlock()".
                - disk driver PDP-11 code: interface code to serial port moved to
                  separate module "pdp11gui_serialio_dl11.mac".
                  This module can be exchanged if running on different serial hardware
                  (Robotron AIS K8060).

23.4.2016   V 1.47.3
                interally serial Format (8N1, 7E1 etc) selectable. (Rüdiger Kurth)
23.11.2015  V 1.47.2
               - Compiling the disk driver always resulted in a "source save to file"
                 This caused an error on Win10 platforms, since driver soures are located
                 in c:\ProgramData\PDP11GUI
               - FormMacro11Source: "Changed" property calculated by compare to disk content.
10.5.2014   V 1.47
               - Error report: When compiling the driver for the "disc image tool"
                 Administrator privileges are needed. Reason:
                 MACRO11 source(listing files are saved in ...\program data\.. folder,
                 which is protected.
                 Workaround: better diagnostic, run PDP11GUI as administrator.
               - Bugfix: After running a MACRO11 program which outputs
                 "ABCD...Z", on HALT contact to console is lost.
                 Bug: data remains in the "RcvScanner" buffer, is cleared now in
                 console.Resync()
27.4.2015   V.1.46
                Bugfix: M9301-YA produces NUL in output -> parsing errors.
                On M9301/M9312 and others a filling <NUL> was interpreted
                as backspace.
5.11.2014   V 1.45.1
                Bugfix: absolute papertape loader could not read 1 byte records
7.10.2014   V 1.45.0
            - Memory dumper can produce standard absolute paper tape records
            - SIMH can be accessed over serial console
              (request on VCFB2014, if running on BlinkenBone)

               (Visual Studio 2012 "Project Properties/C++/General/Platform Toolset")
            -  renamed disk/tape driver files to controller names:
               "pdp11gui_rl02.mac" -> "pdp11gui_rl11.mac"
            -  added RX11 floppy disk controller
10.8.2014   V 1.43.0
            - added M9301 console: like M9312, but prompt is '$' instead of '@'
27.7.2014   V 1.42.1
            - Memory Loader window, Absolute Papertape Format:
              logic allows odd addresses now for start of byte stream.
30.4.2014   V 1.42.0
             - In disassembler pdp11disas.dll, codes for "mfpi" and "mfpd" were exchanged.

26.3.2014   V 1.41.0
               Memory Test Windows now tests for stuck data lines.
25.12.2013  V 1.40.0
            Disc image logic:
            - driver now running in command loop, not HALTing after every command.
             (allows operation under M9312 console emulator)
	     - Renamed Console driver "PDP1134" to "PDP11M9312"

20.10.13    V 1.39.2
            - macro11 now can produce listings with binary data in
                hex notation (instead of octal). This was needed
                while working with a logic analyzer who could only display hex data.
            - now Baudrates 57600 and 115200 are possible
                 (user request)
18.10.13    V 1.39.1
            - In ODT Console CR/LF was not displayed correctly

             - bug fix in ConsolePDP1134U.pas
18.09.2013  V 1.37.0
             - Terminal component from OverbyteIcsEmulVT.TEmulVT
                changed back to plain RichEdit.
                (too much trouble with scrolling and control,
                and no VT100 benefit)
15.09.2013  V 1.36.0
            - new memory loader format: "Absolut Paper Tape"
              Code from Mattis Lind, www.datormuseum.se. mattis@mattisborgen.se
30.8.2012   V 1.35.0
            - SimH 3.9 with stdio-telnet now sends correctly CR LF as "Newline"
              indicator. ConsolePDP11SimHU changed accordingly

8.12.2011   V 1.34.0
                - Migration to Delphi 2009 / Unicode
                - replaced buggy "Indy" telnet component with "OverbyteIcs"

30.10.2011: V 1.33.0
            - New form: Execute over Blinkenlight console"
                gives instruction, how to run a program over console.
            - Memory dumper can now produce switch-toggle instructions for
              blinken light consoles.
            - text files produced by memory dump can be openend in notepad.exe

24.6.2011:
            V 1.32.0
                 completely redesigned disk read/write driver for RL02,RX02,RM02,MSCP implemented.
                 Was a separate branch since Dec 2010.

17.6.2011   V 1.31.4
                Disassemble() bug fixes:
                Calling convention for DLL-function "Dis11()" must be
                "cdecl", not "stdcall".
                Why did this ever work???
14.6.2011   V 1.31.3
            Bug, if "Release" version compiled with "Optimization:
                Memory-bound violation in "Disassemble(),
                some variables change inpredictable!
                Do not use optimization anymore, until fixed.

30.5.2011   V 1.31.2
            - recompiled MACRO11.exe with static libraries ... got error msg
            "The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect"
            on some Win7 systems.

4.5.2011   V 1.31.1
           - minor internal changes:
             URLs changed to "www.retrocmp.com/tools/pdp11gui"
           - microcode filename default ist "EY-C3012-RB-001 PDP-1144 Processor Maintenance Supplementary Listings (microcode) Apr-81.txt"
16.12.2010 V 1.31.0
           - Now 4 memory windows instead of 2.
           - Byte size of Memory window can selected
           - Disk image supports RX02.
           - timeout for disk access is 500ms * block count
            (RX02 is 166ms /rotation, with retry
           - unfixed bug: close of macro11 source editor windows marks the
                editor content as "changed". This prevents loading of new
                disk driver.
5.11.2010: V 1.30.0
           - DiscImage: amount of blocks to transfer in one transmission
              can be reduced (necessary for MSCP controllers and
              slow baudrates ... controller timeout? report by Thomas Hoeffgen)
             - DiscImage: ControllerBaseAddress can be modified
16.8.2010: V 1.29.1
           - Bugfix: on Closing a ChildForm "OnFormShow" was triggered
             (because form style changed between "MDIChild" and "Normal").
             This caused the Disassembly Window to "Examine" all its
             memory cells again.
30.7.2010: V 1.29.0
           - Disassembly window with "from - to" address range
           - memory window "set" does not Examine All
           - machine description files gets processed by macro preprocessor M4
             So modules are only defined once as a "templates"
             and can then be used in multiple machine description files by
             macro resolution.
             New directory "machines", new executables "m4.exe" and "regexp2.dll",
             new batch file "m4.bat".
           - Since IO page scanner and DiskImage tool can not run on 11/34,
             a warning is issued.
17.7.2010: V 1.28.0
           - PDP-11/34 console driver
10.7.2010: V 1.27.0
           - Fake for PDP-11/34 console emulator ready
25.5.2010: V 1.26.0
           - Bugfix: 11/23 CPU (M8186) has slightly different ODT behaviour.
             ConsolePDP11ODTU modified.
           - Internal logging system extended.
18.7.2009: V 1.25.2
          - pdp11disas.dll now compiled with "static mfc", so no
            more dependency to MSVCR80.DLL
23.6.2009: V 1.25.1
         - bad blocks are recorded now with first und last time of occurence.
         - Default directory for data and driver *.mac files now
           in "Common App Data Folder" ("c:\ProgramData" under Vista)

1.6.2009:  V 1.25.0
         - DiscImage: enhanced bad block list.
           All .bad-Files must be renamed to .meta and converted to this new format:
           badblock=2052; cylinder.head.sector=12.4.4; source=Scan; "info=OK reading sector after 2 retries: error location = 2, error = 144270 000100 100000 000000!"
           See chapter 3.2 ff in "DEC Std 144".
          - Bug fix in Console driver for 11/44 and SimH:
            Block-Examine could not switch to single-Examine when
            sacnning illegal addresses/UNIBUS timeouts in I/O page.
          - MemoryDumper/text format: nicer output with multiple values per line.
          - Bug fix: pdp11disas.dll was delivered in debug version. This required the
            debug version of msvcrt80.dll on the target system.

23.5.2009: V 1.24.4
         - fixed "Halt" command for SimH
         - Dissassembly Window now with optional code cache.
           Cache was default on previous versions, this was
           dangerous since PDP-11 may use self-modifying code.
3.5.2009   V 1.24.3
         - Stops on SimH breakpoints are recognized now.
         - Optimizations when loading large macro11 projects.
         - Disk read/write: RLE compression also if readin from disk
         - Upgraded to Jedi JVCL 3.36 .
           Source code editor now repaints on resize,
           JVEditor.LineInformations bottleneck fixed.
15.4.2009  V 1.24.2
         - Bugfix: Examine on SimH crashed for big memory ranges
            (Memory Dumper Window)
           - Bugfix in MemoryLoader, MemoryDumper: fileI/O
         - Optimization: if SimH runs on localhost (127.0.01), Block Deposit data
           are transferred to SimH with a temporary "DO" script,
           not with multiple "deposit" commands.
           But block "Examine" can not be done this way.
         - macro11.exe is bugfixed: no endless loop if illegal
           opcodes/illegal labels occur in source.
 9.3.2009  V 1.24.1
         - Bugfix: a real 11/44 needs 300ms after "CONTINUE" before it can
           receive data over serial port ... console processor?
         - Disk Read/Write: bug fixes
         - Disk Read/Write: ability to perform fast bad sector scan
           (is a normal read without data transmission)

 7.2.2009  V 1.24
         - MemoryDump Tool Window writes memory content to disc.
         - fixed strange error: Examine of big memory ranges
           leads to total crash of host PC: shutdown event!
           Ad hoc patch: Limit block len in "examineAddrList()" in
           ConsolePDP1144U and Console PDP11SimHU.
         - only one form for all disc types, with state control for
           driver, disc and image file.

31.12.2008 V 1.23
         - macro11 now supports .INCLUDE <filename> as ".INCLU"
         - SimH now routes serial device I/O also through stdio telnet connection
         - RL01/R02 read and write disc image
         - MSCP read and write disc image
         - Disc read&write with checksum in serial transmission
         - Disc write with RLE compression, since disc images usually contain large empty areas.
         - MACRO11.EXE is called over MACRO11.BAT, so the user can bring his own
           assembler, if he/she likes.
         - Updates to the PDP-11/70 console panel:
           - "PROG PHY" shows now the HALT position.
           - Under SimH, the switch register is set according to the data switches.


13.11.2008 V 1.22
         - Memoryloader accepts the text format
                   <addr> <value> [<value> ...]
           ----- Example -----
           0140000: 010706 005003 012701 177560 012704 140106 112400 100406
           0140020: 105761 000004 100375 110061 000006 000770 005267 000052

           0140060: 004767 000010 110023 005302 001373 000746 105711 100376
           0140100: 116100 000002 000207 025037 000000 000000 177777
           -------------------
           First word in every valid line must be an octal number (=address),
           else line is ignored.

4.11.2008  V 1.21
         - Baudrates of 1200, 2400, 4800 added, because Ian King
           has an unremovable VAX console 11/03 with 1200.
1.11.2008: V 1.20
        - Execution tool reflects capabilities of
          real machine (only on ODT at the moment)
          - User must tell PDP11GUI the state of RUN/HALT switch
          - depending on that Reset/SingleStep or Run is possible.
          - user guidance on connect failures
          - ODT output scanner rewritten
          - ODT now operable!

        - Corrected display of error line in MACRO-11 source and listing

8.10.2008: V 1.18
        - I/O page scanner
        - pdp11/70 Panel
        - rework: proper internal represantation of
          virtual 16-bit, physical 16/18/22 bit addresses.
        - new file format for Memory Loader: octal Address-Value-pairs in an ASCII file.
        - Start development with real ODT machines:
          one evening with the 11/23+ at www.hatchi.de

          between phyiscal/virtual addresses.
        - Tests for ODT console, thanks to Steve!

28.8.2008:  V 1.16
        Preparation for ODT:
        - "feature" flags specify, which functions (Run,Halt,reset,SingleStep)
          are supported by a certain console.
        - Console for fake 11/44 is an own class now, derived from
          TConsolePD1144
        - new Tool : "Memory Loader"
          loads different styles of memory dumps.

21.8.2008:  V 1.15
        - Rewrite interfaces to Terminal, Consoladapter and physical ports,
          Rewrite Console logic.
          Released to Steve Maddison .. he likes it.

11.8.2008: V 1.14
        - Cleanup, for documentation. Help/about.

2.8.2008: V 1.13
        - Errors in MACRO11 are displayed red in Source and Listing.
        - Disassembly now in own Tool window.

28.7.2008: V 1.12
        - Execute-Form shows a Disassembly of current execution position.
        - Mikrocode of PDP-11/44 can be loaded from scanned listings
          "EY-C3012-RB-001 PDP-1144 Processor Maintenance Supplementary Listings (microcode) Apr-81"

20.7.2008: V 1.11
        - Simulation ofs PDP-11-Memory Management (MMU),
           to convert virtual program counter values into physical addresses.
           The TPdp11MMU-Object has its own MemoryCells, to hold
           a copy of PDP-11-MMU-register values.
           These are coupled with all other memorycells.
           MMU-Tool-Form displays the state of MMO and
           lists the virtual->physical mapping.

13.7.2008: V 1.10
        - SimH can be connected over telnet
        - CPU-Execute: run, stop, single step.
          PC-position is displayed in MACRO-11 source code listing.

24.6.2008:
        - coupled FormBitfields: click onto a memorycell displays in BitField-Form
          informationen about bit of a register. Fully editable.

22.06.2008: V1.00
        - inifile, Terminal, registerlist, memorytable, MDI-Froms,
          simulated PDP11/44, simulated baud rate, Macro11-Source+Listing,
          coupled memorycellgroups.
